For development netpot apps we are use service like HockeyApp is a service for app developers to support them in various aspects of their development process, including the management and recruitment of testers, the distribution of apps and the collection of crash reports.
Open your App.xaml.cs

Search the constructor "App" and add the following line at the top of the method:

HockeyApp.CrashHandler.Instance.Configure(this, "1d2478b99e6e43f1bb9780d4d8c5f1df", RootFrame);

Open the root page of your app (or the page in which you want to check for new crashes), for example MainPage.xaml.cs.

Search the method "Initialize" and add the following line at the bottom:

HockeyApp.CrashHandler.Instance.HandleCrashes();
Build your project and run the app. Note that the crash reporting only works if the debugger is not attached.
