# Hydroculture
Hydroculture is the growing of plants in a soilless medium, or an aquatic based environment. Plant nutrients are distributed via water.
## Techniques
In basic hydroculture or passive hydroponics, water and nutrients are distributed through capillary action. In hydroponics-like hydroculture, water and nutrients are distributed by some form of pumping mechanism.
## Substrates
The roots might be anchored in clay aggregate such as the trademarks LECA and Hydroton.
Advantages include ease of maintenance as watering and feeding involve just topping up the reservoir of growing solution. Certain types of hydroponic media are resistant to some types of soil-borne insects.
